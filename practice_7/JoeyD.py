### Optimizations to consider
# Go cannon mode less against better known opponents
    # In other words, decide on turn 1 what mode to go into instead of at end
# Count cards
    # Knowing what cards you are holding in hand affects the odds of an
    # opponent lying
# In-game strategy changes
    # A player who loses a block_steal can never block a steal that game
    # A player who takes income on turn 1 probably doesn't have a duke
    # etc...
# Watch for overfitting
    # An agent specifically designed to beat a specific other agent is unlikely
    # to be successful generally
