Instructions:
    - Copy this whole file into your own directory
    - Remove the instructor's name from the top and place your name
        - do the same with creation date
    - Follow the problem specifications that follow and make a python
      document that can run without any errors
    - If you want some extra practice, proceed to the extra practice document
    - For a hope score, push your homework to github by Sunday at 8:00 PM
        - If you submit after that, it's fine, but you get 0 marks if
          I grade and don't find your homework

# Problem 1
# Print a random whole number in the range of [1,10] (inclusive)

# Problem 2
# Print all of the perfect squares in the range of [1,10000]
# Note: you should use a loop (100 print statements will get you 0 points),
#       but you don't have to use 'for i in range(10000)' as your statement

# Problem 3
# Open the file `abab.txt` and print the total number of times the character
# 'b' appears in the file
# This shouldn't be hard-coded. You should be printing from a variable!
# Don't forget to close the file when you're done!
# Note: you're allowed to look at how the file was generated if you want


# Problem 4
# Open the file `abab.txt` and print the following:
    # the longest sequence of 'a's in the file
    # the longest sequence of 'b's in the file
